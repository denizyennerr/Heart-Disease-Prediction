# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and analysis of risk factors can help improve prevention strategies. This project explores health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. The goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, the main emphasis is making sure that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**

- Handled missing values by replacing `0` values with `NaN` and filling them with median values.
- Converted categorical columns to proper data types.
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualized distributions of numerical and categorical features.
- Boxplots to compare numerical variables with target class.
- Heatmaps to analyze feature correlations.

### 3️⃣ **Machine Learning Modeling**

- Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Used cross-validation for reliable model performance.
- Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
